# 👋 Hey! I’m Bohdan  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — a place where ideas evolve from “hmm, what if…” into real working projects, bots, tools, and experimental chaos that somehow ends up functioning.  
I love automation, Minecraft bots, and making things run on their own while I drink tea.

## 🚀 My Main Project  
### 🧠 **WheatMagnateBot**
An automated Discord/Mineflayer bot that:
- does tasks without complaining,
- doesn’t need sleep (unlike me),
- stays online forever,
- and tries very hard to look smarter than it actually is.

👉 Repository: **https://github.com/bdiev/WheatMagnateBot**
