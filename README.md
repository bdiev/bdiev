# 👋 Hey! I’m Bohdan  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — a place where ideas evolve from “hmm, what if…” into real working projects, bots, tools, and experimental chaos that somehow ends up functioning.  
I love automation, Minecraft bots, and making things run on their own while I drink tea.

---

## 🚀 My Main Project  
### 🧠 **WheatMagnateBot**
An automated Discord/Mineflayer bot that:
- does tasks without complaining,
- doesn’t need sleep (unlike me),
- stays online forever,
- and tries very hard to look smarter than it actually is.

👉 Repository: **https://github.com/bdiev/WheatMagnateBot**

---

## 🛠 Tech I Work With
- **Node.js / JavaScript** — my main tools.
- **Python** — for scripts, prototypes, and small games.
- **Mineflayer** — the brain behind Minecraft bots.
- **Discord.js** — for bots that talk back.
- **GitHub Actions / CI** — deployment magic without manual suffering.

---

## 🧪 What I’m Currently Learning
- Java — step by step, sometimes with boss fights.
- Modular bot architecture (no more 100,000-line files).
- The perfect sleep schedule… still in beta.

---

## 💡 What You’ll Find in My Repositories
- Minecraft and Discord bots  
- Automation tools and utilities  
- Learning projects and prototype experiments  
- Occasionally useful things. Sometimes brilliant. Sometimes… well, it’s GitHub.
